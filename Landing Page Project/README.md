#3 Instructions

- The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.


#4 Project Description

- This project allows me to implement an interactive website.


#5 Usage

- Clicking the navbar which are sections 1 - 4 will be scrolled down to the respective section.

- When the user is not scrolling the navbar will be hidden.

- The website also have a top button, whenever the user scroll down, the user can click the top button in order to go to the top. 


#6 Installation

- First I put some global variables that are needed in order to call them easier.

- I installed helper functions such as add event listener, scroll top, set timeout, active view port.

- I used foreach method in order to build the navigation bar.

- I added the class active when the section is within the boundary then it will have the class "your-active-class".

- Query selector added in order to scroll to anchor ID using scroll to event

- Hide fixed navigation bar while not scrolling (it should still be present on page load)
